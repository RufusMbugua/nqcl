## Front-End
The system’s front-end is written in AngularJS coupled with package managers and Javascript Task Runners namely:
+ Bower
+ Grunt

## BackEnd
This is written in PHP, riding on [Codeigniter](https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter) version 3.
A particularly Caravel-Like approach was used since there’s a high dependency on [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and a few packages such as:
+ [Flysystem](http://flysystem.thephpleague.com/)
+ [Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/5.1/eloquent)
+ [Fractal](http://fractal.thephpleague.com/transformers/)

## Database
For this project I used MySQL 5.*. 
You could find additional documentation [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/)
