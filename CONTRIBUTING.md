Authored by *Rufus Mbugua* [<mbuguarufus@gmail.com>


If youâ€™d like to contribute to the website, or itâ€™s underlying structure or methodology, there are a couple of things youâ€™d have to do.

## 1. Fork the project
The main integration of the system can be found [here](https://github.com/RufusMbugua/nqcl)

## 2. Dependencies
Update your composer dependencies by running the following command:
```
composer install && update
```
Update your bower dependencies by running the following command:
```
bower install && update
```

## 3. Process Changes
There are a couple of pre-processors and automated tasks that need to run to process and compile your changes.

To do this, run the following command:

```
grunt dev
```

## 4. Issues and Pull Requests
If you find a bug, or would like to add a feature, create an issue and open a PR to the develop branch. Iâ€™ll go over your changes and merge stable changes.
Incase of anything, I will leave a comment on the PR.




Thanks for forking the project ðŸ˜€
